# C Variable Manipulator

Manipulate C source code variables

## Usage

To append text at the end of each variable

```
python3 main.py <source file> [--output <output path/file>] append <append_text>
```

## Motivation

We have to append our roll numbers to the variable names in our CS assignments
<br>And I **HATE** it.<br> 
So I made this so that I can append the roll number to the variable names quickly.
Because the current refactoring tools doesn't have this feature (or maybe I don't know any such tool yet).<br>
It's like a code obfuscator.
